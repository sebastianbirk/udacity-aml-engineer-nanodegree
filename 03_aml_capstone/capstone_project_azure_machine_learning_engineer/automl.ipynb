The dataset contains the target class \"Attrition\" as well as demographic, job-specific, geographic and socioeconomic feature columns. It is a fictional dataset created by IBM Data Scientists. In total the dataset has 1470 rows and 35 columns. I have set aside 20% for testing and have registered 80% as training dataset in the AML workspace (check **explorative_data_analysis.ipynb** for details).\n",
